                    <p>Dan and Ashley met during their first semester at SUNY Oneonta in the fall of 2008. They were 
                        both enrolled in Sociology 101. They sat across from each other in class and Dan remembers 
                        admiring Ashley from a far but not having the courage to move his seat closer. It wasn’t until 
                        they saw each other at a classy Oneonta house party that they became friends. Although the 
                        attraction between them was undeniable, they were both having so much fun during their first 
                        year of college they weren’t ready to get into a serious relationship.</p>
                    <p>It wasn’t until Dan’s senior year and Ashley’s junior year at SUNY Oneonta, that the two made it 
                        official. Dan called Ashley over the summer and told her that he wanted to make her his 
                        girlfriend and couldn’t wait any longer for them to be together. Ashley of course said yes—but 
                        had to play hard to get—so the two became a couple on October 4th, 2010.</p>
                    <p>Dan and Ashley enjoyed spending time together as a couple during Dan’s last year at SUNY 
                        Oneonta. When Dan graduated he was offered an amazing opportunity to work at Rosetta 
                        Digital Marketing in Cleveland, Ohio and their relationship was put to the test. Dan and Ashley 
                        dated long distance during Ashley’s last year of college. Even though they were miles apart they 
                        stayed in love and committed to each other, making sure to visit see each other—using planes, 
                        trains, and automobiles—at least once a month.</p>
                    <p>Upon graduation, Ashley was inducted into Teach For America as a corps member and placed 
                        in Cleveland, Ohio! The happy couple was reunited in Cleveland and enjoyed being together in 
                        the same city. In July of 2013, Ashley and Dan moved into their first apartment together in 
                        Lakewood, Ohio where they lived for one year.</p>
                    <p>Once Ashley completed her corps member experience, she accepted a position at KIPP 
                        Academy Elementary school in the South Bronx. Dan was able to transfer to Rosetta’s New 
                        York office and the couple relocated to Manhattan in July of 2014. Dan and Ashley enjoyed 
                        exploring all that the Big Apple has to offer from Central Park to Times Square, museums to 
                        restaurants, Broadway to subways!</p>
                    <p>On July 3rd, 2015 Dan asked Ashley to accompany him on a trip to their favorite place in the 
                        city—Central Park. He arranged a gourmet picnic lunch and found a secluded spot in the park, 
                        by the lake, for the two to eat. After lunch, Dan asked Ashley to take a picture facing the lake. 
                        When she turned around, Dan was on one knee asking for her hand in marriage. Ashley of 
                        course said yes—but at first said “WHAT?!” because she was completely surprised and 
                        extremely happy! </p>
                    <p>Dan and Ashley are so excited to see where their journey and marriage will lead them, what 
                        new cities and opportunities they will explore, and most importantly how much their love will 
                        grow in the years to come! They are thrilled to be getting married, on their engagement 
                        anniversary, July 3rd, 2016!</p>
